In this assignment you will setup Prototype 3, in which you will create an side scrolling infine runner. At the end of this assignment you'll have a new Unity project with the initial assets imported - with a Git repository on GitHub to manage and backup your work. By this point the process of setting up a new Unity project, importing assets, and creating a Git repository should be starting to feel very familiar.
